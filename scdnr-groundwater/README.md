# scdnr-groundwater
Concept for SCDNR Groundwater Data page -> for finding and viewing well data from SCDNR's groundwater monitoring network. 

- Find a well by location (add searching by well ID). 

- View data for that well's period of record in hydrograph (add input boxes for filtering data by time frame). *Page not accessing data live from server right now... this design concept uses a single test data source for display purposes.*

- Download data based on full period of record or a given time extent as csv. 

Also need to rework the description on the monitoring network on the original page. Add FAQ dropdown to answer some of the questions, use graphs and charts to illustrate network statistics (eg # of wells in aquifers) instead of big paragraphs. 

Add links to other groundwater resources, such as potentiometric map publications page, groundwater reports, coastal plain well inventory, etc.
